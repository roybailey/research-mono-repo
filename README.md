# research-lerna-gatsby
Sandpit project to use lerna mono repo for packages of react components used by a gatsby site 

## Motivation

To stand up a mono-repo using `lerna` and contain both common libraries (such as react components and service adaptors)
and dependent packages using `gatsbyjs` as a server side rendering engine that uses GraphQL
